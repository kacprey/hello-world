# hello-world

Hello internet,

I would like to start with github and all this stuff which is associated with tech people. 
Tech people (called also geeks or nerds) are sometimes freaks, they do not like PR too much, sometimes lack some fundamental soft skills, but they are an interesting people to deal with.
I have a little of technical person in me and I would like to grow it. I hope github will help to shift my brain to become more technical and less typical. And I hope my wife will accept this change.
